It is also one of the major responsible tourism destinations in Kerala. The PEPPER (PEOPLE’S PARTICIPATION FOR PARTICIPATORY PLANNING AND EMPOWERMENT THROUGH RESPONSIBLE TOURISM) project was initially implemented in Vaikom temporarily, and supported by the World Tourism Organisation (WTO). The project encouraged the residents and local bodies to get involved in the decision-making part of tourism activities. Through this project, tourists get a first-hand experience of village lifestyles and can take part in the festivals of the region. The PEPPER project also promotes traditional crafts, like weaving and earthen pot making.  

                            Vaikom is also one of the oldest townships in South India, and was the venue for the Vaikom Satyagraha, the much-famed civil rights movement in Indian history.</p>
